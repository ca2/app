 Abstract:
 A impact that draws text, reasons about layout, and manages a selection over its text range.
 
 IMPORTANT: Its use of CoreText is naive and inefficient, it deals only with left-to-right text layout, and it is by no means a good template for any text editor. It is a toy implementation included only to illustrate how to bind the system keyboard to some pre-existing text editor.
