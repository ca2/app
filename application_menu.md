Application menu represents classical concept of an application menu.

Like the ones in first GUI applications in Unix, Windows, Linux and OS X.

- Arbitration: If application has an application menu it would be reflected by the application menu structure.
- Arbitration: Applications without application menu can display the application menu inlined at notification icon menu
- Arbitration: Applications without notification icon menu can display application menu inlined at system menu
- Realization: Not all systems have a System Menu and/or an Application Menu and/or Notification Area Context Menu, for example Linux.
- Reasearch: Study GTK, KDE ways for displaying a "System", an "Application" Menu, "Context" Menu or "Notification" area Menu.
- Fallback: A ca2 context menu on right click with application menu. (Hey! this is historically veriwell Musical Player initial and main GUI).
