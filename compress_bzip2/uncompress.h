//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Introduce:
This file includes two classes CA2GZIP and CGZIP2A which do compressing and
uncompressing in memory. and It 's very easy to use for small data compressing.
Some compress and uncompress codes came from gzip  unzip function of zlib 1.1.x.

Usage:
these two classes work used with zlib 1.1.x (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/).
They were tested in Window OS.
Exmaple:
#include "GZipHelper.h"
void main()
{
char plainText[]="Plain text here";
CA2GZIP gzip(plainText,strlen(plainText));  // do compressing here;
LPGZIP pgzip=gzip.pgzip;  // pgzip is zipped data pointer, you can use it directly
i32 len=gzip.Length;      // Length is length of zipped data;

CGZIP2A plain(pgzip,len);  // do decompressing here

char *pplain=plain.psz;    // psz is plain data pointer
i32  aLen=plain.Length;    // Length is length of unzipped data.
}
