   Return Values:

   GetElevationType( __out TOKEN_ELEVATION_TYPE * ptet );

   /*
   Use GetElevationType() to determine the elevation type of the current process.

   Parameters:

   ptet
      [out] Pointer to a ::payload that receives the elevation type of the current process.

      The possible values are:

      TokenElevationTypeDefault - User is not using a "split" token.
         This value indicates that either UAC is disabled, or the process is started
         by a standard ::account::user (not a member of the Administrators group).

      The following two values can be returned only if both the UAC is enabled and
      the ::account::user is a member of the Administrator's group (that is, the ::account::user has a "split" token):

      TokenElevationTypeFull - the process is running elevated.

      TokenElevationTypeLimited - the process is not running elevated.

   Return Values:
      If the function succeeds, the return value is S_OK.
      If the function fails, the return value is E_FAIL. To get extended error information,
      call get_last_error().

   IsElevated( __out_opt int_bool * pbElevated = nullptr );

   /*
   Use IsElevated() to determine whether the current process is elevated or not.

   Parameters:

   pbElevated
      [out] [optional] Pointer to a int_bool ::payload that, if non-nullptr, receives the result.

      The possible values are:

      true - the current process is elevated.
         This value indicates that either UAC is enabled, and the process was elevated by
         the administrator, or that UAC is disabled and the process was started by a ::account::user
         who is a member of the Administrators group.

      false - the current process is not elevated (limited).
         This value indicates that either UAC is enabled, and the process was started normally,
         without the elevation, or that UAC is disabled and the process was started by a standard ::account::user.

   Return Values
      If the function succeeds, and the current process is elevated, the return value is S_OK.
      If the function succeeds, and the current process is not elevated, the return value is S_FALSE.
      If the function fails, the return value is E_FAIL. To get extended error information,

   /*
   Use RunElevated() to start an elevated process. This function calls ShellExecEx() with the verb "runas"

   Parameters:

   hwnd
      [in] Window handle to any message boxes that the system might produce while executing this function.

   pszPath
      [in] Address of a null-terminated string that specifies the name of the executable file that
         should be used to start the process.

   pszParameters
      [in] [optional] Address of a null-terminated string that contains the command-line parameters for the process.
         If nullptr, no parameters are passed to the process.

   pszDirectory
      [in] [optional] Address of a null-terminated string that specifies the name of the working directory.
         If nullptr, the current directory is used as the working directory. .

   phProcess
      [out] [optional] Address where to return the handle to the newly started process.
         You must call CloseHandle( *phProcess ) when the handle is no longer needed.
         If phProcess is nullptr, no handle is returned.

   Return Values
      If the function succeeds, the return value is true.
      If the function fails, the return value is false. To get extended error information,
      call get_last_error().

   NOTE: This function will start a process elevated no matter which attribute (asInvoker,
