  Filename:	arc.c
  Purpose:	A Borland Turbo C graphics.h function replacement,
  		for porting to *nix.
  Mod history:	05/01/02 RSB	Created.
  		05/21/02 RSB	Fixed pieslice and fillellipse to use
				fill pattern/color rather than 
				solidly fill with the foreground color.
		05/25/02 RSB	Added the sector function.
		05/27/02 RSB	Split off all of the functions previously
				contained in this file (other than arc
				itself) to their own files.
