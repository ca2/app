  Filename:	cgets.c
  Purpose:	A Turbo C conio function.
  Mod history:	03/04/02 RSB	Created.
  		03/21/02 RSB	Added CgetsEchoOff so that cgets can
				be used to implement getpass.  Also,
				fixed an unreported bug in which 
				cgets will abort after reaching the 
				maximum string length.

// This global variable exists to allow the cgets code (which echoes
// to the screen) to be used for getpass (which does not).  0 is the
// normal state, and non-zero is for getpass.
