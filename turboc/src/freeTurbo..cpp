  Filename:	freeTurbo.c
  Purpose:	This is my custom replacement for the standard library
  		"free" function.
  Mod history:	05/24/02 RSB	Created.

/*  What's the deal with this?  It all has to do with the getimage function
/*  in graphics.h.  The standard usage of the getimage function (and its
  friends) as envisaged by Borland's docs is this:

  1.  Call "imagesize" to find out the size_i32 of the image buffer needed.
/*  2.  Allocate the image buffer with "calloc" or "malloc".
/*  3.  Fill the image buffer with "getimage".
/*  4.  Call "putimage" one or more times to write the image somewhere.
/*  5.  Free the image buffer with "free".

  The problem with this is that because our graphics.h functionality
  works with the X-window system, the graphics data won't *actually*
/*  be stored in the image buffer, but rather in an X-window Pixmap
  structure of which we have an integer handle, but to which we
  don't have direct access.  So when "getimage" is called, it needs to
  allocate the Pixmap ... but there's nothing in this sequence of operations
  that results in the Pixmap being freed later!

  We handle this by adding a little functionality to "free".  "free" checks
  to see if the object being freed is one with which a Pixmap has been
  associated, and if so, frees the Pixmap.  In either case, it then goes
  ahead to free the object's actual memory.

  A linked list is maintained of these Pixmaps that have magically been
/*  created by getpimage->
*/

//#include "graphics.h"

// associated with Pixmaps.

/*   image Pix;

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the function which is called by getimage to associate a Pixmap
// with an already-allocated memory block.  If the block is not in the
// list already, it will be added.  If the block *is* in the list, its old
// Pixmap will be freed and then the new one added.  Returns 0 on success,
// non-zero if out of memory.

      return (0);
   }

   // Note that this is guaranteed to iterate at least once, so if it falls
   // through, we know that LastBlock has been initialized.

            // a different Pixmap.  So free the old Pixmap and associate
