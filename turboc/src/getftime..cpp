  Filename:	getftime.h
  Purpose:	A function for for TurboC. 
  Mod history:	03/02/02 RSB	Created, and disabled.
  		03/23/02 RSB	Re-enabled getftime and slightly corrected
				the tm_mon/tm_mday fields.  For some reason, 
				when I had initially implemented this,
				the linker could not find the fstat function,
				which I then assumed did not actually
				exist.  Works now, though.  Go figure!
