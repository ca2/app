  Filename:		getmaxx.c
  Purpose:		A Borland Turbo C graphics.h function replacement,
				for porting to *nix.
  Mod history:	05/01/02 RSB	Created.
				08/28/10 RSB	Changed the function names from
								getmaxx() and getmaxy() to
								turboc_getmaxx() and turboc_getmaxy(),
								with macros relating the memory_new names
								to the old in graphics.h.  This is
								because (thanks to Dick Borrett) I've
								found that function with this name
								are now present in distros like
								Ubuntu 9.x and 10.x.
