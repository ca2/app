  Filename:	ResizeTurboC.c
  Purpose:	A function to physically resize the text console.
  Mod history:	04/18/02 RSB	Created.
		04/19/02 RSB	Allowed TIOCGWINSZ to be a macro.  It isn't
				in Linux, but is in FreeBSD.  Also, finally
				licked (I think) the problem of getting
				the screen redrawn properly.

  // This is really lame, but ....  The printf statement logically
  // (and actually) accomplishes the resizing of an xterm
  // terminal.  None of the other stuff should be necessary.  
  // However, the resizing takes a certain amount of time, for 
  // reasons unclear to me.  Perhaps it's the passage of time, 
  // perhaps it's a buffer getting filled up ... I don't know.
  // The problem is that stuff may get written to screen positions
  // that don't yet exist, because the sizing has not yet completed,
  // and this can cause a segfault.  Anyhow, the loop is an attempt 
  // to kill time, or fill up the buffer, or whatever.  It aborts
  // if it finds that the size_i32 has actually reached the correct
  // value, so there's not too much harm in it except for remote
  // logins (in which case the remote terminal size_i32 doesn't seem
  // to be determined correctly).  We make a feeble attempt to 
  // determine if the login is remote, so that we can shorten the
  // loop in that case.
  // ... Later:  I don't think there's actually any time penalty
  // for the big loop.  There's some kind of intermittent timing
  // problem with the screen resize when running remotely, but
  // it's not the loop.
