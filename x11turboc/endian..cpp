  Filename:	endian.c
  Purpose:	Functions for converting the endian type of data. 
  Mod history:	03/03/02 RSB	Created.
  
  These are functions which have no purpose for simple CPU-based programs,
  but are needed when reading data to/from a file of a pre-defined format.
  This is typical in Turbo C programs; since they ran only on x86 
  processors, they implicitly assume a little-endian byte ordering
  for data files.
  
  For good measure, big-endian conversion functions are also thrown in, 
  though there's no particular reason for them in Turbo C porting
  (since this functionality would already have to have been handled 
  explicitly anyway -- though not necessarily CORRECTLY if the target
  handler isn't little-endian).
