// The Turbo C function is supposed to return a random number between
// 0 and num-1.  This function doesn't *exactly* do that since the 
// distribution is skewed somewhat by the fact that num probably does
// not exactly divide RAND-max+1.  However, since it's likely RAND_MAX
// is much much greather than num, I'm willing to ignore it rather than 
// correct for it.
